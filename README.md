# # A Random Network Model for Synaptic Plasticity
This notebook provides Python code for simulating a [random network model for synaptic plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01817).

We consider a conceptually simplified random network model for the phenomenon of [synaptic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity). We model the synaptic weight by a stochastic process on a fixed graph img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$G = (V, E)$" />  thought of as a collection of neurons interconnected by synapses.
